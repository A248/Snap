# Snap!

This is the Seriously Necessary Adapter Plugin to enable plugins written against the
 BungeeCord or Waterfall API to load and (kinda) run on [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/). ðŸ‘€

## How?

Simply add the Bungee plugins into the plugins folder inside the Snap plugin folder.

Snap will load the plugins from there and translate methods, classes as well as event
 calls.

## What works?

Most of it (hopefully). I mean that's the goal...

## What doesn't work?

Some functionality isn't easily recreated (e.g. group handling is not a
 thing in Velocity, use [a permissions plugin](https://luckperms.net)) and of course
 anything related to hacking into Bungee-internals or packets wont work.
 Just write a Velocity plugin at that point...

Those functions not supported will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. Please report
 those including the plugin causing them on the issue tracker!
 
If you are sure that the plugin will work fine otherwise then you can have it return
 default values by setting `throw-unsupported-exception` to `false` in the `snap.conf`!

### Not supported:

- Using Bungee's **inbuilt permissions system** to set and get groups/permissions. 
  Don't. Use LuckPerms on Velocity. (hasPermission checks work though)
- **Reconnect server functionality.** That's an inbuilt function in Bungee but better 
  suited for a plugin. The related methods will return `null` or set nothing. Instead
  of erroring.
- **Scoreboards.** Velocity doesn't have API for them and I'm not going to create a 
  packet based one. Maybe there will be a way to integrate in some plugin or Velocity 
  adds support in the future.
- Some **ProxyConfig** settings don't exist on Velocity or aren't exposed in the API so 
  they return some sensible defaults which should reflect the proxy's state.
- Registering commands after a plugin was enabled. I currently have no good way to hook
  into this besides straight up modifying the PluginManager class
- Some connection handling and related events might not work 100% exactly like on 
  Bungee. They are as close as possible though but if you already have to fiddle with 
  that then its best to create a standalone Velocity plugin tbh.
- **Unsafe** doesn't work.

## Sounds awesome! How can I get it?

You can download the jar via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Phoenix616/Snap/releases)
 or get builds from the latest commits from the [Minebench.de Jenkins](https://ci.minebench.de/job/Snap/).

## Is it open source?

Yes, the base code of Snap is open source! It's licensed under LGPLv3 in order to be
 compatible with the shipped Waterfall/BungeeCord.
